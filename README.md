## PROJECT SPECIFICATION

## Cloud Capstone Project

# (Option 2): Functionality

- The application allows users to create, update, delete items

  A user of the web application can use the interface to create, delete and complete an item.

- The application allows users to upload a file.

  A user of the web interface can click on a "pencil" button, then select and upload a file. A file should appear in the list of items on the home page.

- The application only displays items for a logged in user.

  If you log out from a current user and log in as a different user, the application should not show items created by the first account.

- Authentication is implemented and does not allow unauthenticated access.

  A user needs to authenticate in order to use an application.

# (Option 2): Codebase

- The code is split into multiple layers separating business logic from I/O related code.

  Code of Lambda functions is split into multiple files/classes. The business logic of an application is separated from code for database access, file storage, and code related to AWS Lambda.

- Code is implemented using async/await and Promises without using callbacks.

  To get results of asynchronous operations, a student is using async/await constructs instead of passing callbacks.

# (Option 2): Best practices

- All resources in the application are defined in the "serverless.yml" file

  All resources needed by an application are defined in the "serverless.yml". A developer does not need to create them manually using AWS console.

- Each function has its own set of permissions.

  Instead of defining all permissions under provider/iamRoleStatements, permissions are defined per function in the functions section of the "serverless.yml".

- Application has sufficient monitoring.

  Application has at least some of the following:

* Distributed tracing is enabled
* It has a sufficient amount of log statements

* It generates application level metrics

- HTTP requests are validated

  Incoming HTTP requests are validated either in Lambda handlers or using request validation in API Gateway. The latter can be done either using the serverless-reqvalidator-plugin or by providing request schemas in function definitions.

# (Option 2): Architecture

- Data is stored in a table with a composite key.

  1:M (1 to many) relationship between users and items is modeled using a DynamoDB table that has a composite key with both partition and sort keys. Should be defined similar to this:

  ```
  KeySchema:
    - AttributeName: partitionKey
      KeyType: HASH
    - AttributeName: sortKey
      KeyType: RANGE
  ```

- Scan operation is not used to read data from a database.

  Items are fetched using the "query()" method and not "scan()" method (which is less efficient on large datasets)
